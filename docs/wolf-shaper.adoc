*Wolf Shaper* is a free, open-source distortion plugin that lets you create your own waveshaping functions using a spline-based graph editor.

This tool makes the input signal more harmonically rich, which can be useful for sound design and mixing.

== How to use

=== Parameters and controls
- *Pre* – Controls the input volume, before any processing has taken place.
- *Wet* – Determines the mix between the original and the processed signal in the output. Set this parameter at maximum value to only hear the processed signal.
- *Post* – Controls the output volume, after all processing has been done.
- *Center* – Removes DC offset from the output. This ensures that the resulting waveform is vertically centered at zero.
- *Oversample* – Sets the multiple of the sample rate at which the processing will be done. This allows the plugin to filter out some harmonics that would otherwise cause aliasing artifacts.
- *Uni/Bi switch* – Allows switching between symmetrical and asymmetrical waveshaping.
- *Warp knobs* - The two yellow knobs in the middle of the UI allow to bend the distortion curve dynamically. These knobs can be automated by the plugin host for interesting effects.
- *Reset button* – Puts the graph back at its default state, which is a straight diagonal line. 

=== Graph editing
- *Add a vertex* – Right-click in the graph to add a vertex. Keep holding the right mouse button to position the vertex.
- *Move a vertex* – Left-click and drag the vertex.
- *Remove a vertex* – Double left-click on the vertex.
- *Tweak the tension of an edge* – Left-click and drag vertically the tension handle located at the center of the edge.
- *Change the curve type* - Right-click on a vertex, then select the curve type in the context menu.

=== User interface
- *Resize the window* – Left-click and drag the resize handle located at the bottom-right to resize the window.
